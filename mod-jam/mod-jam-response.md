Mod jam response
-	This time, I was really struggling to start the code itself. I wasn’t sure what to do to twist the code, not to mention that I was feeling extra nervous, so I put it off until the last minute. When the deadline was near, I realized that I had to start it, otherwise I would never finish this assignment. Thankfully, my superpower (getting things done very last minute) kicked in, and Sabine was gracious enough to give an extension, so I was able to complete my code. Before jumping into someone else’s work, I wanted to talk about how this experience of coding an actual game helped me understand the class materials better. One of the main reasons why I didn’t start the code (along with the health issues) was that I didn’t understand the class materials well enough, and I was nervous that I would not be able to make any progress in my project. However, the actual coding experience, despite all the stress and panic, helped me understand the class material way better than the assignments, and I believe that I have a better understanding of the class material since I’ve completed my project. I also had a sense of achievement upon completing the project. I appreciate this opportunity to learn better, and I now feel more prepared for the variation jam project. 

-	While working on my project, I also looked at my classmate’s project and inspected their code (it feels unethical, for some reason).  Here are some projects that I really appreciated and learned a lot from.

-  	Blaise
	I was quite surprised when I first looked at Blaise’s game because it was just like what I was thinking of in terms of recreating the game (besides the laser tongue part). I think this game is creative, and I enjoy how the speed of the game gets faster as it passes. 

    Blaise used for loop to create the stars in the back, which reminded me of my art jam project. I wish I could’ve incorporated this part into my code as well. Also, one thing that stood out to me was having a focus of aim. I think this makes the game experience better. I could tell that they invested a lot of time and effort in this game.
- Anna
	Honestly, Anna’s graphic work was fantastic. It made me feel like I was playing an actual game. The introduction page part was so cute, and I liked how the frog slowly moved to the center and talked to the player (with an option to skip, which is really useful). It reminded me of the Nintendo DS game experience. 
    
	Unlike other games, this game stood out in a way that I was able to move the frog using the position of mouseX and mouseY. I think the concept of the game was fantastic and well executed. I would love to ask Anna about her work process. I believe that I will learn a lot from their work.
