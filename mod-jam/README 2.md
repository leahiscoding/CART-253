## Description

> Kermit is trapped in the space! To win this game you'll have to get rid of 15 asteroids (flies) in given time! If Kermit gets hit by the asteroids 10 times or cannot hit 15 asteroids in given time, the player will lose the game.
> The experience is controlled via spacebar and arrow keys. Player can move kermit using the arrow keys and shoot the laser using the spacebar.

> The project is meant to give the user a sense of escaping the space and getting rid of the asteroids. I replaced flies to asteroids to emulate the feeling of space.
