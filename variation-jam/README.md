## Description



> *Ether* is a cybe world experience that allows the user to experience three different stages of the world

> The experience is controlled both via buttons and enter

> Once you enter Ether, there are three different sections. If you press 1 or click one third of the screen, that will bring you to the "screen.html". You can press A to take a picture of the screen. If you press 2 or click the middle third of the screen, that will bring you to the "text.html", which grants you a wish. If you press 3 or click the last third of the screen, that will bring you to "last.html", which is a variation from the frog frog frog game. If you press 1,2, and 3 in each HTML, it will bring you back to the "ether.html" screen. 

> The project is meant to give the user confusion and allows the user to explore the hidden function.
