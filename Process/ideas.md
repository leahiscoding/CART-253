# Mod Jam Instructions

A title and instructions screen. Could the frog be used to start the game? Could the frog eat the title?
An ending. How should the game end? Because the frog explodes with flies? Because it starves? How can you tell the game is over?
A scoring system. But not just a standard number counting up on the screen.
New kinds of fly movement. Sine wave? Random movement? Perlin noise? Teleportation? Controlled by a second player?
New visual and/or audio effects. Frog’s eyes follow the fly? Sound effects for all major actions? Fly flaps its wings? Frog hops around instead of sliding?

<For a perfect score, make sure to add at least two other features to the experience. You could consider:>

Visually bringing the fly back to the frog’s mouth on capture. Relative positioning needed for this
A new control system. The keyboard is an obvious choice here? Or clicking where you want the frog to go? Or telling it where to go? Or having it move on its own? Or being able to control the tongue while it’s moving?
etc.

5. There wil be bombs and the frog has to dodge it
6. If the frog misses more than 10 files then the game will be over
