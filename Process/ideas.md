# Mod Jam Instructions

A title and instructions screen. Could the frog be used to start the game? Could the frog eat the title?
An ending. How should the game end? Because the frog explodes with flies? Because it starves? How can you tell the game is over?
A scoring system. But not just a standard number counting up on the screen.
New kinds of fly movement. Sine wave? Random movement? Perlin noise? Teleportation? Controlled by a second player?
New visual and/or audio effects. Frog’s eyes follow the fly? Sound effects for all major actions? Fly flaps its wings? Frog hops around instead of sliding?

<For a perfect score, make sure to add at least two other features to the experience. You could consider:>

Visually bringing the fly back to the frog’s mouth on capture. Relative positioning needed for this
A new control system. The keyboard is an obvious choice here? Or clicking where you want the frog to go? Or telling it where to go? Or having it move on its own? Or being able to control the tongue while it’s moving?
etc.

# Mod Jam Ideas

1. There are pesticides flying around alongside with flies (what happens if the frog eats pesticides? will the frog die? or will the frog become a superfrog? H)
2. There are two (or more) frogs (Will they go against each other? Or will they corporate to find more flies and share them? If they are other frogs, do other people get to control them? Or do I have to use an AI?)
3. Frog is an actually a mouse and flies are cheese (Would it still be frogfrogfrog if frog becomes a mouse? Wouldn't that turn this game into a different game? Or could this be a sequence game of frogfrogfrog?)
4. There are bones flying around and if the frog gets hit by the bones the frog will die(Why bones? Will there be both bones and flies or just bones?)
5. There wil be bombs and the frog has to dodge it (Quite simliar to the bone idea, but I guess it could be different because if the bomb explodes, then the surrounding area will be affected by it)
6. If the frog misses more than 10 files then the game will be over (If the flies are moving fast of if there are a lot of flies wouldn't it be too difficult to win the game?)
7. Frog can not only move horizontally but vertically (What would be the difference if the frog can move vertically? Is there a limit to a vertical movement? If the frog can move vertically across the canvas wouldn't the game be too easy?)
8. If you click on the frog 10x the frog will die (Maybe an easter egg?)
9. Frog has three lives (What happens if the frog loses three lives? Will there be an item that makes the frog regain the life if he loses one?)
10. Frog has to eat certain elements within the time limit. Otherwise, frog will die (what elements and how many of them? if there isn't enough elements flying around within the time, isn't that an automatic lose?)
11. Frog is afraid of bugs( well this is interesting. So instead of catching the flies, the frog has to dodge the flies)
12. People want to get rid of frogs (How would people attempt to get rid of the frog? What should frog do in order to survive?)
13. Frog will be angry if he doesn't eat flies every 10 seconds and will eventually die (Well... this is really sad lol I think the angry part is interesting and maybe frog will explode if he doesn't eat enough flies?)
14. Frog can actually slice fruits using his tongue (This sounds also interesting, but I don't know how to make this into a game. It would look like a fruit slicing game, though)
15. Flies can attack the frog (Instead of catching the flies, it would be a war game (frog attacking other frogs and all))
16. Frog has to save his lover frog (This idea kind of reminds me of Mario in a sense that he has to save his so-called lover. I think this could be a fun idea)
17. If frog eats certain flies, frogs get to bomb all the flies(Would frog gain a superpower by eating a specific fly? But wouldn't bombing flies mean no flies at all? What happens if the frog bombs all the flies?)
18. Frog needs to dodge the cars. Otherwise, frog will get hit by the cars (Definitely gives off the crossy road vibes, but with an extra step. I wouldn't mind but the game has to continuously change. I don't know if it's possible to make it happen hmmm...)
19. Frog is a worker in a caplitalist society. Frog needs to get certain amount of flies within the limited amount of time not to get fired (This sounds really depresseing... but I guess I can turn him into a worker frog)
20. Each fly has a different score. If frog eats a black fly, frog will be poisoned and die. If frog eats a white fly, frog will go to heaven and automatically win the game (This actually sounds more feasible. I think I can use if and endscreen function to create the ending)
21. Frog can have fever time if frog eats a stardrop (I have been playing too much of stardew valley... but stardrop sounds like a good plan!)
22. Frog has a short tongue :/ frog can only eat flies around him, but he can jump to the other stones to catch flies (So there would be stones that frogs can fly onto, and i guess the frog has to jump to catch the flies. It would be a bit difficult to coordinate both actions)
23. Frog is in love with a bee and now they need to find a way to convince their families (I am definitely sleepy... but say that they want interspecies marriage or relationship how can we apply that to this game? this idea brings me back to #16)
24. Frog lives in a matrix. In order to know the truth, frog must find the red pill (honestly I don't hate this idea. It sounds quite interesting. Definitely one of the things I can consider when it comes to remaking this game)
