Although I didn’t get to see everyone’s work, the art jam vernissage was a fantastic experience. I learned about different backgrounds and the work of my classmates. One of the things that stood out to me is that their disciplines are evident in their work. Some students are taking this class as an elective, and I was able to guess that they’re not specialised in CART based on their artwork. It’s probably because I studied graphic design briefly before, and their work reflects that they have a background in graphic design.

Here are some of my favourite pieces from the art jam vernissage:
#1 Fragments of the Self by Edmond Peng
    When I first saw this piece, I instantly noticed the details and could tell that Edmond has a background in design. I was really fascinated by the interactive part of this piece—how individual pieces hover in their own distinctive way, and how each of them has a different effect. The code is written simply and cleanly, but the way this code is executed made me think that it was written in more complex code. It was also interesting that we could apply different effects to images. I wonder if it’s a vanilla JS function or a function from the p5.js library. Regardless, this piece inspired me a lot and made me want to find a way to integrate and utilise my images because I enjoy manipulating images using Photoshop. I think I could also use videos/audios and make it more interactive for my final project.

#2 Billy the 8ball by Sama
    It was truly fascinating to see Sama’s artwork. Unfortunately, I didn’t get to speak to them, but when I checked their artwork on Discord, I was so captivated by it. This truly feels like computation art at its core. Despite understanding the concept of an array, I think I don’t fully understand this code. I plan to revisit the code and check out the tutorials Sama referenced. What I like most about this code is its interactivity and intricacy. As you hover your mouse over the numbers, they turn into a character that eventually creates the 8-ball. I also noticed that if you press your mouse, there’s a little circle in the code that feels like a flashlight. After seeing this piece, I was curious about two things: First, do they have experience with an interactive art piece or perhaps design? Second, how does this 8-ball represent themselves? I enjoy that I am curious about their artwork.

#3 A Perfect Day by Anna Tsirbas
    What stood out most to me about this piece is how it makes me feel like I’m playing a mini game. When I looked at the code, I could tell that Anna spent a lot of time working on it. I also liked the little drawings Anna created. They really give the feeling that I’m experiencing Anna’s day-to-day life and how they feel about their work, assignments, resting, eating, and so on. I also appreciated the heart system and how each response created a different reaction.

Extra! Bitmap artwork by Skylar
    I was absolutely fascinated by Skylar’s work. I really enjoyed both the audio and visual aspects of this piece. Unfortunately, they didn’t post their work on Discord, so I couldn’t examine their code. They told me that they drew this photo of themselves from a selfie, and that made me realise they spent a lot of time and effort on their project. It was really pleasing visually, and I look forward to seeing their projects in this class.

Aside from the works I’ve mentioned, I thoroughly enjoyed everyone’s work, and I am amazed by the effort the entire class put into creating their projects. This vernissage motivated me to push further and create work I am proud of and happy with. It also made me think about how to incorporate elements from others’ work—such as things I liked or thought could benefit my project—into my own.
